# Netcode R&D — Ledger

One entry per tested hypothesis, newest first. The loop appends here after
every benchmark verdict; keep entries even for losses — they are the map of
dead ends.

## 2026-08-01 — H1: Global world clock [KEPT]

- Branch: netcode/global-world-clock (merged into netcode/rd)
- Scenarios (vs cfb4f6c baselines, 3 runs each): baseline-3p-100ms PASS
  (all deltas sub-floor), jitter-heavy-3p PASS (remoteVsRemote p95
  4.14→3.98px), encounter-3p-100ms PASS (~0 deltas), fps-varying-3p PASS
  with **jerkRms 1293→1129 (−12.7%, improved, ~3× the run-noise band)**.
- Headline: at steady 60fps the per-entity estimators are near-identical to
  a global clock (all entities share one arrival stream), so deltas are ~0.
  The win appears exactly where the hypothesis predicted: fluctuating frame
  rate, where the baseline's 5%-per-frame nudge changes its effective time
  constant. Fixed via shared WorldClock with τ=0.3s exponential form.
- Harness note: this iteration ADDED `fps-varying-3p` (oscillating 30–90fps
  render clocks, out of phase) because steady-fps bots were structurally
  blind to this hypothesis — committed separately on netcode/rd (e57b0de)
  with its own baseline before judging.
- GDScript port pending (remote_snake.gd estimator → shared clock in
  game.gd; use `1 − exp(−dt/τ)` nudge). Tier-2 validation with it.
